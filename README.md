# covid-19-modeling
Modeling work for coronavirus outbreak

So far, this small project includes

1) A jupyter notebook that explores a logistic model for total number of cases in different geogrpahies

2) A .ode file for use in XPPAUT that contains the equations for the basic SIR model. Loading it into XPP will automatically run the simulation and plot the time series for all variables.
